    <p>Welcome to my portfolio. Very WIP</p>
    <p>I am a Computer Engineering student at the University of Cincinnati. I am very interested in PCB design, embedded systems, and other hardware design. Here I will detail my skills, projects, and any other information you may like to know. I will treat this as a very in depth extension of my resume and GitHub. Thanks for stopping by.</p>
